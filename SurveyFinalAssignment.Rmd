1. The Innovation panel would interview multiple people from every household, but in the case households are very large, a Kish Grid is used. Can you explain why the Kish Grid is a popular method to do within-household selection of respondents?

2. Despite the complex data structure, the design weights as included in the variable "a_psnenip_xd" have a very low variance. Can you explain why this is the case?

3. Apart from the design weight, an enumerated design weight "a_psnenip_xw" is also included. Please show using syntax in R how you can calculate this weight.
